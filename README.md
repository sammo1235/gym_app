## gym app ##

An app for tracking workouts, training volumes and wilks scores for powerlifting (PL).

The three PL lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift (sumo or conventional)) will be used to
calculate either a projected wilks score (in the case of working sets being entered)
or an actual score (from the best three 1RMs a user has performed).
